# Proposal to add MKR 
Proposal to add MKR as a capped collateral to Interest Protocol.

## Overview
The MKR token governs the Maker Protocol, which is one of the oldest and most battle-tested protocols in DeFi. The Maker Protocol issues the DAI stablecoin, and is one of the only protocols to not suffer technical exploits (there was a design exploit that resulted in some 0-bid liquidation auctions in 2020 that has since been fixed).

This collateral integration will support MKR holdersâ€™ ability to delegate MKR to a delegate contract of their choice, which is not available at any other venue.

Interest Protocol already supports CHAI, which is a DappHub token wrapper for DAI Savings Rate Module deposits.
